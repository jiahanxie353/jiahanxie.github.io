- I love music, especially classical music - I started to learn violin after I got into college. I had a wonderful experience playing essemble with people in the Cornell Bowers CIS end-of-year party.
- For sports, I love weight lifting, hiking, and biking - I biked from Washington DC to New York City in four days during my spring break in 2025.
- I love wine tasting. I was fortunate to enroll in Cornell Hotel School's Wine tasting class and got into a complete new world.
