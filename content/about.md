I am a first-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering/) at [UC Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/) working with [Jos√© Renau](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~renau/) in the [MASC group](https://masc.soe.ucsc.edu/). I received an MS in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/master-science-computer-science) from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) in May 2025, where I was advised by [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) in the [Capra group](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/). Prior to that, I received a BS in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) and a BS in [Environmental Engineering](https://cals.cornell.edu/environmental-engineering) from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) in May 2023, where I was advised by [Fengqi You](https://www.peese.org/professor/) in the [PEESE group](https://www.peese.org/). I also obtained a BE in [Environmental Engineering](http://www.cers.zju.edu.cn/ceren/2019/0812/c35429a1466307/page.htm) in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

I am interested in Computer Architecture and Compilers. At the UCSC MASC group, I'm working on developing AI hardware agents for chip design. At the Cornell Capra group, I worked on the [CIRCT project](https://circt.llvm.org/), the [Calyx project](https://calyxir.org/), and the [Allo project](https://cornell-zhang.github.io/allo/) to build an open-source high-level synthesis tool flow from PyTorch to FPGA to accelerate machine learning models. At the Cornell PEESE group, I worked on developing multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithms for demand response in smart cities.

**Name Pronounciation:** My first name is pronounced as "ja-han". My last name is pronouced "shieh".
